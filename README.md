# ProgressionGen

ProgressionGen is a program that generates music trained on the MusicNet corpus, a corpus of 300 pieces of classical music.
MusicNet can be found here: https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~thickstn/musicnet.html

Language models used generate music include the MLE from the NLTK LM package, Markovify (an implementation of a markov chain), and textgnrnn (an implementation of a recurrent neural network). Example outputs of the program can be found in the directory "midi_files". For more details, see the file report.pdf.
